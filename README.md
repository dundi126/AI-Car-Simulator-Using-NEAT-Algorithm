# AI Car Simulation Using NEAT Algorithm

This project is an AI-powered car simulation using Python, the NEAT algorithm, and Pygame. The goal of the simulation is to demonstrate how neural networks and genetic algorithms can train a car to navigate a track autonomously.

## Features

- AI-driven car simulation
- Training using the NEAT algorithm (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)
- Interactive environment created with Pygame
- Visualization of the car's performance as it learns and improves

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or later is recommended).

## Install & Dependence

- python
- pygmes
- python-neat

## Use

- Navigate to the project directory:
  ```
  cd ai-car-simulation/
  ```
- Run the main Python file to start the simulation:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
